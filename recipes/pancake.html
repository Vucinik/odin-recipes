     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk,
         but it's the best I've ever made!</p>
    
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
     </ul>

     <h4>Steps</h4>
     <ol>

    <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
         Beat buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl.
         Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li>
    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.
         You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles,
          it's ready.</li>
    <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture;
         use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together.
          The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</li>
    <li>Pour or scoop batter onto the preheated griddle,
         using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake.
          Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes;
           flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side.
            Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
